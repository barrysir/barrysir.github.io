In-depth explanations of the inner workings of Hunterstory, in case you want to min-max or just feel like learning something new about an old flash game.  

All info is taken from the decompiled source code of the Hunterstory swf found in the downloads page (Hunterstory v1.27a).  
A lot of the mechanics are interconnected so I'll fill in more detail into pages as I figure out more of the inner workings.
