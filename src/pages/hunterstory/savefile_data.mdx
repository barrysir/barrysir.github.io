title: Savefile Data

### Location

Hunterstory stores its savedata as a .sol file (search up flash sol file editors), in a file named `keylog1337.sol`.  
Depending on what you use to run flash games, you may have to search up yourself where your save data gets placed. But here are some examples:  

 * General .sol file folder:
   * **Windows**: `%appdata%/Macromedia/Flash Player/#SharedObjects/(random numbers and letters)/`
   * **Mac**: `~/Library/Preferences/Macromedia/Flash Player/#SharedObjects/(random numbers and letters)/`
   * **Linux**: `~/.macromedia/Flash_Player/#SharedObjects/(random numbers and letters)/`
 * This folder will contain a bunch of other folders. Where your Hunterstory save data will be depends on what you're playing on. 
   * If you're playing on a standalone flash player, it'll most likely be in `localhost`
   * If you're playing on Kongregate, then it'll be in `chat.kongregate.com` or `kongregate.com`
   * etc.
 * Some directories along the way might be hidden; search up how to show hidden files and folders on your operating system.

### Savefile Description

Here's a listing of every key within Hunterstory's .sol file, and a description of what they do:
