Various tips submitted by me or other people.

#### S-Ranking Missions

Mission Score is based on accuracy, repel rate, and the arrow points, which are based on air time/hang time (up to 80 frames) and the mob's distance away. Here's what I did to S-rank everything:
 * Use B-55 SPIKE. After hitting a mob, the arrow bounces and stays in the air, which maximizes the hang time of the arrow.
 * Aim high so arrows spend a long time in the air before coming down. You can use the UI above the hunter to help aim your cursor (I like to put my cursor somewhere around the "100%" in "Power: 100%")
 * Fiddle around with the timing of the arrow and the angle until you can shoot an arrow right when the monster appears and have it hit. This maximizes the distance of the mob.
 * The B-55 might bounce on a few mobs heads before dropping, be careful not to overshoot and drop accuracy.
 * Grind until you get an S. (it may take a lot of tries -- especially Green Snails Only!!!!!!)

#### Grinding

This should be fairly obvious after playing for a while, but boss missions and rush missions are the fastest ways to gain EXP.

#### Screen Switching (only available on standalone flash player) {#screen-switching}

_(thanks to Mocakola for pointing me to the video below and this glitch!)_

Right-clicking on the game will bring up the default Flash right-click menu, which has some buttons that can change the frame the Flash file is on; or, within Hunterstory, switch between game screens.

The order of the screens is as follows: title screen, mission select, game screen, mission complete screen, the bow shop, key configs, reset game data, the curiosity shop, the stat sheet, badges, and secret badges. You can move forward with the Forward button, and return to the title screen with Rewind or Back. Play will rapidly switch through all of the frames, but only on the game screen or after. (Not too helpful, but it looks cool!)

This can be used to speed up boss grinding. [Here is an example video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eSp__av8dG0) By forwarding after taking down the boss, you can skip killing 25 grunt mobs to finish the mission! However, you won't get as many mesos because your mission grade will be lower, so don't use it all the time. 

Less importantly, you can use it to access the curiosity shop before level 30, and the secret badges page before you've unlocked any secret badges. The stat sheet also becomes free, by forwarding in the curiosity shop.

#### Seeing Monsters Beyond The Edge Of The Screen

The normal edge of the screen is at x=625, but monsters spawn at x=666. Depending on where you're playing, you may be able to stretch the resolution of the window to see the monster spawn point. giving you some extra reaction time to hit the monsters sooner and thus get more points.
