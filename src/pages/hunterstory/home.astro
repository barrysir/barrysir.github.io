    If you are reading this, then you are using the offline version of my Hunterstory guide!<br>
    I hope you find this offline version useful!<br>

    Welcome to my Hunterstory guide! I was bored one day, so I made this on a whim, and now it's been my on and off project for a few years.<br>
    Hunterstory was made by Crovy/Crovax, and is currently on V1.27a, with no signs of an upgrade.<br>
    In Hunterstory, you kill monsters in missions and level up.<br>
    Although it may sound boring, it's actually quite fun if you're good at it.<br>
