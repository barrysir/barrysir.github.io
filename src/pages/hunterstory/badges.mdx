## Secret Badges

1\. **Hacker**   
Crovy does too kick butt. Trust me, I know.

2\. **OMFG FIRST!!!1**

3\. **Honour**  
Isn't it more fun when there's a challenge? (See below for the backstory on this badge.)  
(Ascend 16 times, and accept the warning sign.)    
4\. **?**   
! Don't ask me how you found this.   
(Press Shift-/, or type ?)   

#### <u>About Honour</u>  

_Originally, you had no max on BP per ascent, so your 151st ascent would give 155 BP. Realizing this was broken when a few people were at a few hundred ascents, Crovy changed it to the 20 max that you get on ascents 16 and forward. But he still had to rectify those who had already gotten ridiculous levels of BP. So when someone who had more than 16 ascents before this changed ascended, they were brought to a different ascension screen. It explained the situation briefly and asked the player to agree to go back to 16 ascents with the new system, given all the BP of their first 16 ascents (200 total) to redistribute from scratch. They had the option to agree or say no._  

_Upon agreeing, they would get the Honour! secret badge. If they say no, they will be begged for about 5-10 clicks of the button, until they're forced into it anyway, not getting the badge. If they clicked yes at any of those times, however, they got the badge._

_(Thanks Kris!)_
